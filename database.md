3. What is a Replica in MongoDB?

A replica in MongoDB means having copies of the same data stored on multiple MongoDB servers.
This system of maintaining copies is called a Replica Set.

👉 In simple words:

Replication = Data Backup + High Availability

It ensures that even if one server fails, the system continues to work using the copies on other servers.
