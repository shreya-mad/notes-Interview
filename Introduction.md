Currently, I’m working as a Software Engineer at Global Infoventures Pvt. Ltd., where I develop and maintain web applications using React.js, TypeScript, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and SQL.

At Global Infoventures, I’m working on a centralized application named “Software for Institute Management”, which manages data for multiple colleges across India through a single platform.
I have worked on various dynamic and role-based modules such as:

Admission Form – manages student details, program selection, and document uploads.

Hostel Allotment Form – handles room allocation and vacancy tracking.

Reimbursement Form – used by students and staff to submit and approve expense requests.

Transport Allocation, Library Management, and Fees Tracking modules as well.

Currently, I’m working on the Dashboard module, which is a role-based web application that provides authorized access to departments like Admin and Faculty.
It displays key data such as fee records, student attendance, and performance trends, helping the institute monitor overall progress.
The dashboard also includes LLM integration to generate smart insights and summaries from data, and I’m now implementing a voice-enabled chatbot that allows users to ask questions about data, modules, or reports and get instant responses directly within the dashboard.

Before this, I worked as a MERN Stack Intern at Cuvette Pvt. Ltd. for 6 months, where I worked on several projects using the MERN stack, including:

Job Posting and Searching Web Application – with secure authentication and authorization using JWT and bcrypt, and role-based access for recruiters and job seekers.

Capstone Project – which includes an interest-based movie search system similar to Netflix, and a self note-making module for managing and organizing notes.

Quiz Creating Web Application – where users can create quizzes, share them, and track their progress.
